# Imgur Takeover

Tonight's training involves taking over [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) with javascript! You will need to write a function for each of the following requests below. Once you have successfully tested the function in the browser, copy and save your code in `solutions.js` with an appropriate functionName.


### The Tasks
- Create a function that changes the navbar to a different color.
  > Hint: This could be called changeNavColor();

- Add a new `<h1>` to the top of the page that says `<h1>This page is now under *YOUR NAME*'s control!'</h1>`.
- *Remove* half of the images (from the DOM) and *hide* half of the remainder (CSS display property).
- Create a function that prompts the user to type "please" after clicking an image in order to see it larger.
  > Hint: You will need to use event.preventDefault();

### Bonus
- On the Home page, change random image links to point to a YouTube video instead of their intended destination.
- On the Details page, create a function that will randomly click either "upvote" or "downvote".
- On the Details page, hide all comments under the image that are below a given points threshold.
> Example: Hide all comments that are < 2,000 points
